<h2>WHY DID I CHOOSE CSE ?</h2>
  <P>Computer Science degrees are some of the most popular study programmes worldwide.As we live in a digital age, most industries rely on data and software programmes. Computer Science & IT impacts everything, from scientific research to health development, transport, banking, communications, you name it. Even objects like microwave ovens, fridges, or door locks are now connected to our Wi-Fi networks and personal assistants.

Technology has made the world better, faster, and more connected. But this didn’t happen by magic. We arrived here thanks to the brilliant minds of IT graduates, who took their passion for technology and used it to create gadgets and computer programmes which help us every single day.

You can be one of the people who work on innovations that will take humanity forward.With a Computer Science degree, you’ll learn all the concepts and skills you need to answer these questions and many others. Technology is part of our future, and it is up to people like you to decide how it will impact and shape our world.

You don’t need to dream of becoming the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. After all, Windows is still buggy, and even iPhones are not what they once were. But you can develop the next generation of gadgets or software programmes which will improve the lives of millions of people.</P>
